_Pulse aims to give a visual interpretation of when the next resources tick happens. This can be used by multiple classes but the most prominent one might be rogue and his energy regeneration._

## What is Pulse?

Pulse is a simple addon that tracks the energy-regen tickrate and the current amount of energy. The energybar will show up once the player spent some energy.

## FAQ

#### I get a red error (Lua Error) on my screen. What is this?

This is what we call a Lua error, and it usually happens because of an oversight or error by the developer (in this case me). Take a screenshot off the error and create a GitHub Issue with it, and I will see if I can resolve it. It also helps if you can add any additional information of what you were doing at the time and what other addons you have active. Additionally, if you are able to reproduce the error make sure to check if it still happens if you disable all others addons.
